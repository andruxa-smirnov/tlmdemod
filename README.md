GOES-16 CDA Telemetry Demodulator/Decoder
=========================================

These three programs demodulate, decode and demux the **GOES-16 CDA Telemetry Signal** generating `.tlm` files that can be further processed by the user. This project currently supports the 40 Kilosymbol CDA Telemetry Signal coming from GOES-16. In the future it will *probably* support all Thrid Generation NOAA's GOES Satellites (GOES-R, GOES-S, GOES-T, GOES-U).
